Forked version now works with i3 and other lightweight window managers.

This is a initial idea to save the National Geographic's Photo Of The Day. I love this photos, then I can set them as my desktop background image, what I did before manually.

The forked version uses [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) to set wallpapers.  This is a dependency.


## How to use

install feh with your packagemanager

  e.g. `sudo pacman -S feh`

clone files to `$HOME/.config/nat-grab`

run `getDesktopBG.sh`
